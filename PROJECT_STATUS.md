# SEAM Project Status

## Current headline

**2026-07-30 — HISTORY#504 (IN PROGRESS).** Branch
`refactor/unify-retrieval-paths` is local-only and the one-engine RRF ranking is
**not promotable**. HISTORY#503's full 1,542-question provider-free A/B measured
a −0.010804 context-recall regression that it could not attribute to any single
leg. Per-leg trace instrumentation now exists; the attribution ablation is the
gate. See `docs/status/retrieval.md`.

## Status streams

| stream | covers |
|---|---|
| [`retrieval`](docs/status/retrieval.md) | ranking policies, legs, fusion, the open ablation gate |
| [`benchmarks`](docs/status/benchmarks.md) | LoCoMo, WANDR, BEAM, integrity levels, recorded audits |
| [`surfaces`](docs/status/surfaces.md) | CLI, shell, TUI, webui, REST, MCP, SDK, installers |
| [`compression-visual`](docs/status/compression-visual.md) | MIRL/RC, SEAM-LX/1, SEAM-HS/1 surfaces |
| [`packaging-licensing`](docs/status/packaging-licensing.md) | distribution shape, licensing, public/private boundary |
| [`protocol-continuity`](docs/status/protocol-continuity.md) | history protocol, streams, routing, context budget |
| [`operations`](docs/status/operations.md) | pgvector, Docker, CI, guardrails, operator workflows |
| [`deferred`](docs/status/deferred.md) | explicitly parked backlog |

## Provenance of this restructure

The previous revision accumulated 143 stacked `Current update:` blocks across
~1,037 lines (348 KB) and could no longer be opened by a standard file read,
despite being step 1 of the mandatory session-start read order.

Nothing was discarded:

- The full prior file is preserved verbatim at
  `docs/status_archive/2026-07-30-project-status-full.md`.
- All **234** distinct `HISTORY#` entries it cited remain present in
  `HISTORY.md` (verified: zero missing).
- Every non-chronological bullet was routed into a status stream above.

Verify with `python -m tools.status.verify_streams`.

## Working Rule

When resuming:

1. Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file).
2. Read the relevant stream from `docs/status/index.md`.
3. Read `REPO_LEDGER.md`.
4. Read `HISTORY_INDEX.md`.
5. Read `docs/CODE_LAYOUT.md`.
6. Read `docs/DATA_ROUTING.md` when the task touches history, ledgers,
   maintenance records, routing, context budget, or auditability.
7. Read `SEAM_SPEC_V0.1.md` + `docs/MIRL_V1.md` — the governing contract — when
   the task touches compilation, MIRL/IR, compression, PACK, retrieval,
   surfaces, codecs, the improvement loop, benchmarks, or any design or
   measurement claim.
8. Pull only the required `HISTORY.md` entries via
   `python -m tools.history.build_context_pack`.
